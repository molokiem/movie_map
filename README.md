## Description

'WENT TO WAR WITH THE NAV BAR' - MATT M.

- Our motivation was to build a working product that allowed our users to find a movie to watch within their specified genre and find snack stores within their area to accompany the viewing of the movie.

- We learned the importance of teammwork and how to use GitHub Flow to complete our project. During this time, we learned the importance of web API's and how they play a role in building a website.

## Installation

- Our user needs a working web browser, a desire to watch a movie, and a sweet tooth
